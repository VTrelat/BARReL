BARReL is a Lean~4 library that allows proof obligations generated by the industrial tool Atelier~B to be interactively discharged inside the Lean proof assistant.
Partial operators such as min, max, cardinal and relational application are encoded as dependent functions and realized via metavariables that are subsequently reified into separate well-formedness goals alongside the original proof obligations, all as first-class Lean goals.
The implementation relies on Lean metaprogramming rather than a trusted external translator, and is designed to be modular: extending the supported B fragment typically requires only adding new syntax and encoding clauses.
We illustrate the approach on a small but representative case study, and discuss how BARReL could be used as a stepping stone towards a strongly trusted Atelier~B toolchain based on Lean.
