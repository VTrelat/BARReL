\barrel is a Lean~4 library that imports proof obligations generated by the industrial tool Atelier~B and lets users discharge them interactively inside Lean, using the usual tactic language and mathlib infrastructure.
Partial operators such as min, max, cardinality and relational application are encoded as functions guarded by explicit well-definedness conditions, which are themselves reified as separate propositions and exposed as first-class \info[?] Lean goals alongside the original proof obligations.
The implementation is written entirely using Lean metaprogramming rather than a trusted external translator, and is designed to be modular: extending the supported B fragment typically requires only adding new syntax and encoding clauses.
We illustrate the approach on a small but representative case study, and argue that \barrel can act as a stepping stone towards a strongly reliable Atelier~B toolchain grounded in the Lean proof assistant.
