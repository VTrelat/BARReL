% \barrel is a Lean~4 library that imports proof obligations generated by the industrial tool Atelier~B and lets users discharge them interactively inside Lean, using the usual tactic language and Mathlib infrastructure.
\barrel is a Lean~4 library bridging the B method tool Atelier~B and the Lean proof assistant by enabling users to conduct their formal B developments---up to machine refinement and implementation---interactively inside Lean, while retaining standard B syntax.
B partial operators are carefully encoded by generating explicit well-definedness conditions, leveraging Lean's dependent types to enforce a well-definedness discipline by construction.
That is, proof obligations and proof steps cannot silently rely on ill-typed or ill-defined instantiations.
\barrel also features basic automation to try to discharge such well-definedness conditions automatically.
The implementation is written entirely using Lean meta-programming and is designed to be modular: extending the supported B fragment typically requires only adding new syntax and encoding clauses.
We illustrate the approach on a small but representative case study, and argue that \barrel can act as a stepping stone towards a strongly reliable Atelier~B toolchain grounded in the Lean proof assistant.
